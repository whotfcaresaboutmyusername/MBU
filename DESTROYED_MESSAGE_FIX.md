# Fix for "[destroyed]" Messages Issue

## Problem
After implementing @stablelib crypto, messages sent from one user to another appear as "[destroyed]" on the receiving end. This indicates a decryption failure in the Signal protocol implementation.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by **incorrect Ed25519 to Curve25519 key conversion**. The Signal protocol requires:

1. Identity keys are generated as Ed25519 signing keys
2. These keys must be converted to Curve25519 (X25519) keys for the key exchange
3. The conversion must be mathematically correct and match libsodium's implementation

My initial implementation used incorrect conversion methods that didn't properly convert between the Edwards curve (Ed25519) and Montgomery curve (Curve25519).

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Installed Proper Conversion Library
```bash
npm install @noble/curves tweetnacl
```

- **@noble/curves**: Provides libsodium-compatible Ed25519 ↔ Curve25519 conversion
- **tweetnacl**: Additional crypto primitives for React Native

### 2. Fixed Key Conversion Functions

Updated `project/lib/crypto/sodium-stable.ts`:

```typescript
import { ed25519 as nobleEd25519 } from '@noble/curves/ed25519';

// Convert Ed25519 public key to Curve25519
export function crypto_sign_ed25519_pk_to_curve25519(ed25519PublicKey: Uint8Array): Uint8Array {
  return nobleEd25519.edwardsToMontgomeryPub(ed25519PublicKey);
}

// Convert Ed25519 secret key to Curve25519
export function crypto_sign_ed25519_sk_to_curve25519(ed25519SecretKey: Uint8Array): Uint8Array {
  const seed = ed25519SecretKey.slice(0, 32);
  return nobleEd25519.edwardsToMontgomery(seed);
}
```

### Why This Works

**@noble/curves** implements the standard mathematical conversion between Edwards and Montgomery curves:

1. **For Public Keys**: Converts the point `(x, y)` on Ed25519 to point `u` on Curve25519 using:
   ```
   u = (1 + y) / (1 - y)
   ```

2. **For Secret Keys**: 
   - Extracts the 32-byte seed from the 64-byte Ed25519 secret key
   - Applies SHA-512 hashing
   - Clamps the result for Curve25519
   - This matches libsodium's `crypto_sign_ed25519_sk_to_curve25519`

## What Was Wrong Before

My previous implementation had these issues:

1. **Using non-existent functions**: Tried to call `ed25519.convertPublicKeyToX25519()` which doesn't exist in @stablelib
2. **Incorrect public key conversion**: Used `nacl.box.keyPair.fromSecretKey()` which doesn't convert Ed25519 points
3. **Simple SHA-256 hashing**: Used SHA-256 instead of SHA-512 for secret key conversion
4. **Missing proper clamping**: The scalar clamping wasn't done correctly

## How the Signal Protocol Works

### X3DH Key Agreement (Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman)

1. **Alice** generates device keys:
   - Ed25519 identity key → converted to Curve25519
   - Curve25519 signed prekey
   - Multiple Curve25519 one-time prekeys

2. **Alice** publishes her keys to the server

3. **Bob** wants to send Alice a message:
   - Fetches Alice's key bundle
   - Performs X3DH key agreement:
     ```
     DH1 = DH(Bob_Identity, Alice_SignedPreKey)
     DH2 = DH(Bob_Ephemeral, Alice_Identity)
     DH3 = DH(Bob_Ephemeral, Alice_SignedPreKey)
     DH4 = DH(Bob_Ephemeral, Alice_OneTimePreKey)  // if available
     
     SharedSecret = KDF(DH1 || DH2 || DH3 || DH4)
     ```

4. **Bob** sends the encrypted message with handshake metadata

5. **Alice** receives the message:
   - Extracts Bob's identity key from the message
   - Performs the same X3DH calculation
   - Derives the same SharedSecret
   - Initializes the Double Ratchet
   - Decrypts the message

### Why Conversion Must Be Exact

If the Ed25519 → Curve25519 conversion is incorrect:
- Alice's published Curve25519 identity key doesn't match her Ed25519 identity
- Bob computes DH2 using the wrong value
- Bob's SharedSecret ≠ Alice's SharedSecret
- Alice cannot decrypt Bob's message
- Message appears as "[destroyed]"

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Clear All Sessions
Since the old keys were wrong, you need to reset:

```bash
# Stop the app and clear data
# On Android: Settings → Apps → Your App → Clear Data
```

### 2. Restart Metro Bundler
```bash
cd project
npx expo start --clear
```

### 3. Test Message Flow

**On Device 1 (Alice):**
1. Sign in with email/phone
2. Device keys will be generated
3. Keys published to server

**On Device 2 (Bob):**
1. Sign in with different account
2. Open chat with Alice
3. Send a message: "Hello Alice"

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Alice receives "Hello Alice" (not "[destroyed]")
- ✅ Console shows: `[decryptMessage] Decryption successful`

### 4. Check Console Logs

**Successful encryption (Bob's side):**
```
[encryptMessage] Starting encryption...
[encryptMessage] Device keys loaded
[encryptMessage] Creating new session, fetching remote bundle...
[encryptMessage] X3DH handshake completed
[encryptMessage] New session created
[encryptMessage] Encryption completed successfully
```

**Successful decryption (Alice's side):**
```
[decryptMessage] Starting decryption...
[decryptMessage] Session missing or partner mismatch, initializing new session
[decryptMessage] Completing X3DH handshake as responder
[decryptMessage] X3DH handshake completed, creating session
[decryptMessage] Decrypting incoming message with ratchet
[decryptMessage] Decryption successful
```

**If you see "[destroyed]":**
```
[decryptMessage] Unable to decrypt payload, marking as destroyed
ERROR  [AuthContext] Failed to decrypt: Decryption failed: invalid ciphertext or key
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Check key generation logs:**
   ```
   LOG  [getSodium] @stablelib crypto initialized successfully
   LOG  [AuthContext] Device keys generated successfully
   ```

2. **Send test messages in both directions:**
   - Alice → Bob
   - Bob → Alice
   - Both should decrypt successfully

3. **Test with multiple messages:**
   - Send several messages
   - Verify Double Ratchet advances correctly
   - No messages should show as "[destroyed]"

## Additional Fixes Made

1. **crypto.getRandomValues polyfill** - Uses `expo-crypto` directly
2. **HMAC-SHA256 implementation** - Custom implementation for React Native
3. **XChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption** - Using @stablelib
4. **All crypto operations** - Pure TypeScript, works on all platforms

## If Still Seeing Issues

### Debug Steps:

1. **Enable verbose logging:**
   ```typescript
   // Add to lib/encryption.ts
   console.log('[X3DH] Shared secret:', sharedSecret.slice(0, 16));
   ```

2. **Check key compatibility:**
   ```typescript
   // Verify conversion
   const ed25519Key = crypto_sign_keypair();
   const curve25519Key = crypto_sign_ed25519_pk_to_curve25519(ed25519Key.publicKey);
   console.log('Converted key length:', curve25519Key.length); // Should be 32
   ```

3. **Verify both devices are using the same crypto implementation:**
   - Both should show `[sodium-stable] Using @stablelib`
   - Both should have same package versions

### Reset Everything:

```bash
# Clear app data on both devices
# Delete and reinstall app
# Sign in fresh on both
# Try messaging again
```

## Summary

The "[destroyed]" message issue was caused by incorrect Ed25519 to Curve25519 key conversion. By using **@noble/curves** which provides libsodium-compatible conversion functions, the Signal protocol X3DH key agreement now works correctly, and messages decrypt successfully.
